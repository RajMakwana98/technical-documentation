          <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web
          pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and
          Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages.
          Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which
          defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate
          (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it
          and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages
          are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has
          to be done on the text. HTML is a markup language which is used by the
          browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in
          required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The
          first ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 but the first standard version
          was HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999.

              <h3>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:</h3>

                <h2>
                  <code>
                    &lt;tagname&gt;Content goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt;
                   </code> 
                </h2>

                <p>HTML documents consists of a tree of these elements and they specify how HTML documents should be built, and what kind of content should be placed in what part of an HTML document.</p>

                <h2>HTML Tag vs. Element</h2>
                <p>
                    An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag.
                    <p>
                <p>For example, &lt;p&gt; is starting tag of a paragraph and  &lt;/p&gt; is closing tag of the same paragraph but  &lt;p&gt;This is paragraph &lt;p&gt; is a paragraph element. &lt;/p&gt;
                </p>

                <h2>HTML is Not Case Sensitive</h2>
                <p>HTML tags are not case sensitive: &lt;p&gt; means the same as &lt;/p&gt;.</p>
                <p>The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.</p>

              <h2>The Poem Problem</h2>
              <p>This poem will display on a single line:</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>
                <code>
                <pre>
                  &lt;p&gt;
                  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
                
                  My Bonnie lies over the sea.
                
                  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
                
                  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                </pre>
              </code>
              </p>

              <p>My Bonnie lies over the ocean. My Bonnie lies over the sea. My Bonnie lies over the ocean. Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.</p>

              <h2>Solution - The HTML <pre> Element</h2>
              <p>The HTML &lt;pre&gt; element defines preformatted text.</p>

              The text inside a &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
                <code>
              <pre>
                &lt;pre&gt;
                My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
              
                My Bonnie lies over the sea.
              
                My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
              
                Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
                &lt;/pre&gt;

            <p>HTML links are hyperlinks.</p>
            <p>You can click on a link and jump to another document.</p>
            <p>When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.</p>

            <h2>HTML Links - Syntax</h2>
            <p>The HTML &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:</p>
                <code><b>&lt;a href="url"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;</b></code>            
            <p>By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
              <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
